cd andreneves.me

This is the source code for my personal website.
Made use of @dhg’s Skeleton (super lightweight CSS framework)

** Feel free to use my code **
Feel free to use my code in any way. My personal website is just a place to demonstrate my work, so take whatever you want from it. 

I initially created this in plain HTML, CSS & JS, but later imported it into @meteor so that I can continue to add features to it and make it reactive. If you haven’t checked out Meteor, do that now.
